### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a degree in Civil Engineering from Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFSC/Brazil), master's degree in Civil Engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC/Brazil), and currently a PhD candidate in the postgraduate program in Civil Engineering at UFSC, in the area of Infrastructure and Geotechnics.

I conclude my master's degree in 2020, working on the recommendation of a suitable range for the incorporation of conductive nanomaterials in asphalt mixtures, using linear and multiple regression models from mechanical, thermal and rheological data collected in the laboratory.

During this trajectory, I worked with databases related to other studies with nanomaterials, and developed a project aimed at analyzing the factors associated with the incidence of deaths in traffic accidents on federal highways in the state of Santa Catarina, using the R language.

Currently I work with Python, R and SQL for the development of my doctoral thesis, seeking to establish models of behavior of asphalt mixtures with self-repair potential.
